# Metro-Car-Funnel-Analysis
#### Data-driven Funnel Analysis on the Customer Journey
## üåé Background
Metrocar's business model is based on a platform that connects riders with drivers through a mobile application. Metrocar acts as an intermediary between riders and drivers, providing a user-friendly platform to connect them and facilitate the ride-hailing process

## üî≠ Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing the customer and Rider experience of Metrocar. We tryed to identify opportunities for improvement and optimization through a Funnel Analysis. We used a [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HEiP4kOojeOjysy5AUcG5eqFUgBsenFy?usp=sharing) and **SQLAlchemy** to query the Data from the **PostgreSQL Database**. For analysis, and data Vizualisation we used **pandas, numpy, plotly, seaborn** and **matplotlib**.


## üéØ Objectives                                                          
Answering the following Questions:
* Are there any significant drop-off points preventing users from completing their first ride?
  * If yes, can our Data help us reduce the biggest drop-off points?
* What steps of the Customer Journey should we research and improve?
* Are there any significant drop-off points preventing drivers from fullfilling orders?

## üîç Methodology                                                     
Our first task was extracting the raw data working on a  Jupyter Notebook hosted on Google Colab, using "SQL Alchemy" Python Library to exctract data from a PostgreSQL Database, across five key tables, generating a wide array of metrics. The main focus was on understanding the dataset using Pandas. In this process we answered several Business related Questions and visualize our data to make it easy to understand. 
Next we collected the Data Necessary to build our Funnels and Visualize them.


## üí° Key Findings                                                        

### Users lost Funnel
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4be1a6e2-2094-41bd-900d-8475c4bbd002)
* Nearly half of the users, who have a driver accepting their request, do not proceed to complete the ride.

## 

### Orders fullfilled
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6fcc9b5-403c-458c-9da7-4207b1638db9)
* 35.6 % of ride requests are not accepted. 

## üìà Recommendations                                              
### 1. Tracking cancellation source
By pinpointing these sources, we can develop targeted strategies to address and reduce cancellations, ultimately improving the overall success rate of ride completions.

### 2. Potential Survey for Cancellations
Potential questions could address aspects such as satisfaction with the app's usability. Simply adding this additional step in the cancellation process could help reduce churn by itself.

### 3. Investigating the Reason why one-third of ride requests are not accepted
This could be due to various reasons such as driver unavailability, mismatches between driver and rider locations, or system inefficiencies. We could start by surveying a select Group of our drivers who are in this group to find out about some of the Reasons they didnt accept a ride.
